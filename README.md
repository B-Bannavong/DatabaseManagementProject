# DatabaseManagementProject
For this project, our goal was to develop the front and back end of a web application that utilizes data 
stored in a Microsoft Azure database. Using C++, ASP.NET Framework and SQL, we were able to query the tables 
in our database from the back end and display the information on the web page. HTML was used for front end webpage design.
